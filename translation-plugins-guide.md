## Medical Equipment Translation Considerations

   - Build a glossary of medical terms in TranslatePress or WPML

2. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Ensure translated content meets medical regulatory requirements in target countries
   - Maintain proper disclaimers and warnings in all languages

3. **SEO for Medical Equipment**
   - Medical equipment searches are often specific
   - Use SEO add-ons to optimize each language version
